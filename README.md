# Data_Visualization_Project_6030

Group - 6

Topics: Crimes in Baltimore


In this project we have created 4 visualizations of which the first(Leaflet) and the second(scatterplot) visualizations which shows the Hotspots based on the Probablity and Intensity for the crimes in Baltimore.
The third(geojson map) and the forth(line chart) visualizations shows the counties which have been created combining multiple neighborhoods and shows the total crime with trends from 2012-2017.

This project could be helpful for the Baltimore Police Department to find the crimes based in Baltimore with only few clicks rather than going through the verbose documentations.
