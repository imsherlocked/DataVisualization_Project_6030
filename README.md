Group - 6

Topics: Crimes in Baltimore

In this visualization we have created the first(Leadflet) and the second(scatterplot) visualizations which shows the Hotspots based on the Probablity and Intensity for the crimes in Baltimore.
The third(geojson map) and the forth(line chart) visualizations shows the counties which have been created combining multiple neighborhoods and shows the total crime with trends from 2012-2017.

This project can be used to find the crimes based in Baltimore with only few clicks rather than going throgh the verbose documentations.
